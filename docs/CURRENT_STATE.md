| M0 — Specification Freeze | ACCEPTED / PASS |
| M1 — Configuration Foundation | ACCEPTED / PASS |
| M2 — 9Router Integration + Selective Model Manager + First Controlled Pi Runtime PoC | ACCEPTED / PASS |

| M4 — Routing + Health + Infrastructure Fallback Engine | ACCEPTED / PASS |
| M5 — Routed Subagent Execution | NEXT PLANNED / NOT STARTED |

## Stable / accepted capabilities

M2 adds these accepted capabilities to the M1 configuration foundation:

- a real Pi extension entrypoint loaded explicitly from the local development build;
- a dynamic `9router` Pi provider exposing only explicitly enabled routes;
- separate complete remote catalog and enabled Pi model set;
- exact remote model IDs, stable local route identity, and distinct routes for distinct resources;
- new catalog models disabled by default and missing configured models retained as unavailable;
- an endpoint-bound, validated last-known-good catalog cache;
- environment-backed `SecretRef` resolution at the network boundary with no raw credential persistence;
- `/orchestrator`, `/9router-models`, `/9router-refresh`, and `/9router-status`;
- a searchable TUI model manager with explicit enable/disable flow and active-model disable protection;
- fake 9Router catalog and OpenAI-compatible chat endpoints; and
- passing actual Pi model-list, completion, and RPC command integration tests.

M3 adds accepted, configuration-only pool management:

- exactly three canonical Investigation, Implementation, and Verification pools;
- ConfigStore-backed add/remove membership and independent per-pool enable state;
- ordered route priorities with move-up, move-down, and arbitrary-index reorder;
- exact ordering persistence, history, and serialized same-process mutations;
- cross-pool membership without deduplication;
- retained globally disabled, missing, stale, and provider-unavailable memberships;
- distinct same-model routes preserved by stable route identity;
- one Pi-native editor reused by all three `/orchestrator` pool sections;
- `/pool-models` and `/pool-status`; and
- actual Pi/fake-gateway pool mutation, reload, and provider-regression proof.

These capabilities do not implement runtime routing, worker execution, or full multi-agent orchestration. Pool order is configuration priority only.

## M4 accepted capabilities

M4 adds the accepted pure, non-executing routing boundary and runtime health state:

- deterministic ordered eligibility and preview selection for the three pools;
- explicit `none`, `prefer`, and `require` diversity inputs with no model-name inference;
- bounded same-route retry, fallback, cancellation/invalid-request stop semantics, and loop-free attempt chains;
- structured quota, rate-limit, authentication, timeout, transport, provider/model, protocol, cancellation, and unknown failure classes;
- injectable `HealthStore` runtime JSON with atomic persistence, cooldown/retry-after, circuit state, success recovery, corruption quarantine, and manual reset;
- `/routing-status`, `/route-health`, and `/routing-settings`, plus Routing & Fallback and Health & Quotas sections in `/orchestrator`;
- fake-clock deterministic tests and isolated Pi `0.84.1` fake-gateway RPC/reset evidence.

M4 does not implement actual child/subagent execution, Boss runtime, Task Packet or Context Broker runtime, canonical mission state, quality review/escalation, analytics, auto-tuning, or full cost/budget-aware routing. It does not persist health in ConfigStore/export/history or reconstruct opaque 9Router account/combo fallback.

| M4 acceptance evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Deterministic, fake integration, and actual Pi suite | `86/86 PASS` |
| Typecheck, build, and aggregate check | PASS |
| Actual Pi `0.84.1` fake RPC | PASS — routing commands, preview, persisted health reset, M2/M3 regressions |
| Paid calls / live environment changes | `0` / NONE |

| M3 acceptance evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Deterministic, fake integration, and actual Pi suite | `70/70 PASS` |
| Typecheck and build | PASS |
| Actual Pi pool editor over RPC | PASS — add, reorder, status, save, reload |
| M2 provider regression after pool edit | PASS — expected fake routes: `5`; Pi exposed: `5` |
| Paid calls / live environment changes | `0` / NONE |

## M2 acceptance evidence

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Deterministic and fake integration tests | `58/58 PASS` |
| Actual Pi with fake model catalog | PASS — expected enabled fake routes: `5`; Pi exposed: `5` |
| Actual Pi with fake completion | PASS — `PI_FAKE_9ROUTER_OK` |
| Actual Pi RPC command test | PASS |
| Paid calls | `0` |
| Live Pi configuration modified | NO |
| 9Router configuration modified | NO |
| Credentials persisted | NO |
| Keychain modified | NO |

## Open risks and not-yet-verified work

### Live 9Router metadata

The live probe was skipped because credentials were not present in the Codex environment. The following remain unverified:

- real live model count;
- live metadata shape;
- stable resource/provider identity;
- subscription/account identity; and
- combo attribution.

Fake-gateway metadata behavior is not proof of live 9Router metadata.

### Human TUI smoke

Automated Pi-native dialog callback and RPC tests passed for the M2 model manager and M3 pool editor. A real human keyboard-driven TUI smoke has not yet been performed. This remains explicit open validation.

### Deferred capabilities

- workers/subagents and Boss runtime;
- Context Broker and Canonical Mission State runtime;
- quality escalation;
- analytics collection, storage, dashboard, and auto-tuning;
- cross-process configuration locking; and
- Keychain credential adapter.

## Next milestone rule

M4 is accepted by STATE-4. M5 — Routed Subagent Execution is next planned and not started. Do not start M5 from this handoff.

## Accepted evidence history

- M0: `56cb8e04b3aefdbfe28e41f20794570a61751029` — `docs: freeze initial orchestrator specification` — ACCEPTED / PASS.

- M2: `43f810cc9c6fbda50abd69b94d5f8aad1597756a` — `feat(pi): add selective 9Router model manager` — ACCEPTED / PASS; evidence recorded above.
- M3: `e2efde838d84197f1fbe289e3e8ded090bdd2d87` — `feat(pools): add execution pool manager` — ACCEPTED / PASS; `70/70` tests, typecheck/build, and actual Pi/fake-gateway pool mutation/reload evidence passed.
- M4: `cae53b220e4cb78ec8b1f4f0400c9be4bb5a9697` — `feat(routing): add health-aware fallback engine` — ACCEPTED / PASS; evidence HEAD `f5e25e21bbebe7995a9cc050efea3ed20d94f18c`, `86/86` tests, and isolated Pi/fake-gateway routing/health evidence passed.

## Assumptions agents must not make

- Do not assume this extension is installed in the live Pi configuration.
- Do not treat fake-gateway evidence as live 9Router proof.
- Do not treat configured pools as runtime routing or worker execution.
- Do not assume M5 has started merely because M4 is accepted.
- Do not treat accepted pool management as runtime routing or worker execution.
- Do not assume a GitHub remote, tag, public release, or stable package exists.
